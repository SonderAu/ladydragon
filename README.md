# Lady Dragon Account Tracker
This plugin is being developed alongside a self-hosted account tracker.
Aimed at clans wanting to get visibility of clanmate progress, to provide incentives.

Where did the name originate?
Widely regarded as the best spy plane globally, the Lockheed U2 was nicknamed Lady Dragon. 
This project is meant to tagline "Oversight at a glance". 

Inspiration derived from [Ch](https://github.com/christoabrown) and his GroupIronman.men platform.
